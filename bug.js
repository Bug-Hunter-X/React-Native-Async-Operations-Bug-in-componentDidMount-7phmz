In React Native, a less common bug involves incorrect handling of asynchronous operations within the componentDidMount lifecycle method, especially when fetching data.  If you don't properly handle the asynchronous nature of data fetching (e.g., using promises or async/await), you might encounter issues where the component tries to render before data has been received. This could lead to unexpected UI behavior like blank screens, errors, or crashes.  Another example involves incorrect state updates where the component's state is not properly updated after an asynchronous operation completes, leading to stale data being displayed.
