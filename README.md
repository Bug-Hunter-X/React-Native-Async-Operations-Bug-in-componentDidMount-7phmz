# React Native Async Operations Bug in componentDidMount

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications related to asynchronous operations within the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method. The bug arises from incorrect handling of data fetching, resulting in the component rendering before the data is available. This leads to unexpected UI behavior like blank screens or errors.

## Bug Description
The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code.  The component attempts to render before fetching data is complete, resulting in errors.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code that utilizes `async/await` or promises to handle the asynchronous operation correctly, ensuring that the component renders only after the data has been fetched successfully.
